<h3>Long Description:</h3>
<p>
  This is a project created by Jonathan Petz for Tarleton State University's Particle Modeling Group. 
  The purpose of this application is to view N-Body simulations in a 3D environment. 
  The secondary purpose of this application is to take screenshots, to be compiled into a video, 
  in order to demonstrate the particle group's findings.
  The final purpose of this application is to allow me to create a pseudo game engine / 
  hone in on my OpenGl programming skills, while also providing a viewer to the TSU Particle Modeling Group.

<h3>Why this is under a MIT license:</h3>
<p>
  I wanted to be able to share the code that I have created for the group with anyone else 
  who wants to create videos of their N-Body simulations. I also want people to use this as a starting point,
  and modify this application in order to make it better. This allows the group to continue the particle viewer, 
  long after I have left the group / University, while also allowing outside sources to assist in any 
  development issues / to improve the viewer.
