## TL;DR: 
A viewer for N-Body simulations.

## Long Description:

This is a project created by Jonathan Petz for Tarleton State University's Particle Modeling Group. The purpose of this application is to view N-Body simulations in a 3D environment. The secondary purpose of this application is to take screenshots, to be compiled into a video, in order to demonstrate the particle group's findings. The final purpose of this application is to allow me to create a pseudo game engine / hone in on my OpenGl programming skills, while also providing a viewer to the TSU Particle Modeling Group.

## Currently Used Libraries:
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) 
* [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) 
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) 
* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) 
* [Tiny File Dialogs](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/)

## Utilities Used:

## Why this is under a MIT license:
I wanted to be able to share the code that I have created for the group with anyone else who wants to create videos of their N-Body simulations. I also want people to use this as a starting point, and modify this application in order to make it better. This allows the group to continue the particle viewer, long after I have left the group / University, while also allowing outside sources to assist in any development issues / to improve the viewer.
