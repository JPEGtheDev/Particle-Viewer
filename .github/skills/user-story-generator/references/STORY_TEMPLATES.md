## Feature Story Template

```markdown
**Title:** [Feature name – user-centric outcome]

**Type:** Feature  
**Size:** S | M | L  
**Epic:** [Parent feature or initiative]  
**Priority:** P0/P1/P2

---

### User Story

**As a** [user role: developer, tester, product manager]  
**I want to** [action/capability]  
**So that** [business value or outcome]

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** [precondition], **When** [action], **Then** [expected result]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome with metrics if applicable]
- [ ] [Edge case or error handling]
- [ ] [Performance or quality target]

### Example for Framebuffer Capture:

- [ ] Image data is captured with correct RGBA format and proper vertical flip (OpenGL origin compensation)
- [ ] Handles edge cases: no active framebuffer, resolution changes mid-capture
- [ ] File I/O succeeds with no memory leaks (validated with Valgrind)

---

### Technical Notes

- `WindowManager` class managing window lifecycle
- All state passed as constructor dependencies

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/graphics/FramebufferManager.hpp` (new)
- `src/graphics/FramebufferManager.cpp` (new)
- `src/main.cpp` (refactored to use new manager)

---

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Old code deleted (no dead code left behind)
- [ ] All tests pass on CI
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No performance regression (benchmark before/after)
- [ ] Refactoring checklist applied (remove duplication, improve names, etc.)
```

## Spike Story Template

```markdown
**Title:** [Investigation goal – specific question to answer]

**Type:** Spike  
**Size:** S  
**Timebox:** [Max hours/days to investigate]  
**Decision Required:** [What choice needs to be made?]

---

### User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want to** investigate [unknown area]  
**So that** we can decide whether to [build/adopt/refactor/migrate]

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Proof-of-concept code (if applicable) demonstrates [key concern]
- [ ] Recommendation provided: [Option A / Option B / Make more data available]
- [ ] Known limitations and open questions documented
- [ ] Timebox respected – no runaway research

---

### Technical Notes

**Open Questions:**
1. Does Framework X support headless rendering?
2. What's the performance overhead of capturing frames every frame?
3. Can we integrate this without breaking existing CI pipeline?

**Research Methods:**
- Proof-of-concept implementation (2 hours)
- Benchmark against alternatives
- Team discussion and decision

---

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Research document in `/docs/spikes/`
- [ ] PoC code (if any) in temporary branch
- [ ] Decision recorded with rationale
- [ ] Follow-up story created for chosen path
```

## Sub-task/Breakdown Example

When a larger story is broken into subtasks, use this format:

```markdown
**Parent Story:** Create Framebuffer Capture Utility

### Subtask 1: Design FramebufferCapture Class
- [ ] Define public API (methods, error codes)
- [ ] Document memory ownership (who deletes buffers?)
- [ ] Sketch architecture: OpenGL initialization, capture, conversion

**Estimate:** S (2–3 hours)

---

### Subtask 2: Implement Frame Capture
- [ ] Write FramebufferCapture::captureFrame() method
- [ ] Test with manual OpenGL context in isolated test
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no framebuffer bound, resolution mismatch)

**Estimate:** M (4–6 hours)  
**Depends on:** Subtask 1

---

### Subtask 3: Implement PPM File Writing
- [ ] Write pixel data to PPM format
- [ ] Ensure vertical flip is correct
- [ ] Test with ImageMagick `display` to verify output

**Estimate:** S (2–3 hours)  
**Depends on:** Subtask 2

---

### Subtask 4: Unit Tests & Integration
- [ ] Write GoogleTest tests for FramebufferCapture
- [ ] Mock OpenGL calls
- [ ] Test in headless mode with Xvfb

**Estimate:** M (4–6 hours)  
**Depends on:** Subtasks 2–3
```

---

## Customization Examples

### BDD-Style (Given/When/Then)
```markdown
- [ ] **Given** a valid OpenGL context, **When** captureFrame() is called with resolution 1920x1080, **Then** a 1920x1080 PPM file is created within 16ms
```

### Metric-Based
```markdown
- [ ] Frame capture latency ≤16ms (60 FPS budget)
- [ ] Memory overhead ≤50MB per capture
- [ ] Zero memory leaks (Valgrind report)
```

### File/Component Specific
```markdown
- [ ] Tests in `tests/graphics/FramebufferCaptureTests.cpp`
- [ ] Implementation in `src/graphics/FramebufferCapture.{hpp,cpp}`
```

## Tips for Good Story Templates

1. **Keep titles short and user-centric** – action-oriented, not technical jargon
2. **Use "As a / I want to / So that"** – grounds the story in user perspective
3. **Break large acceptance criteria into bullets** – easier to track progress
4. **Include Definition of Done** – prevents "almost done" stories
5. **Reference files and components** – clarifies scope and touchpoints
6. **Estimate subtasks, not epics** – individual subtasks should be S/M
