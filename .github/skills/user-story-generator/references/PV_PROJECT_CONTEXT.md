# Particle-Viewer Project Scope Gate

## Step 1: Understand the Request — Verify Project Scope First

**CRITICAL: Verify Project Scope First**

Before asking any other questions, **load and review** [references/PARTICLE_VIEWER_CONTEXT.md](references/PARTICLE_VIEWER_CONTEXT.md) to understand:
- **What this project actually does** (it's a VIEWER for pre-computed simulations, NOT a simulator)
- What components exist vs don't exist
- Current architecture and pain points

**Do NOT assume functionality based on project naming:**
- "Particle-Viewer" = visualization tool, not physics engine
- Reads particle data from files, doesn't compute physics
- Focus on rendering, file I/O, camera controls, visual testing

**If the user mentions functionality that doesn't exist in the project**, ask:
> "Just to clarify—are you planning to add [feature], or did I misunderstand the scope? I want to make sure we're working on something that fits the project's purpose as a [viewer/simulator/etc]."

## Using Project Context

**ALWAYS load project context FIRST before generating any story.**

Throughout the conversation, Load project-specific references **when needed**:

### For Particle-Viewer stories:
**Load [references/PARTICLE_VIEWER_CONTEXT.md](references/PARTICLE_VIEWER_CONTEXT.md) IMMEDIATELY when:**
- User requests ANY story for this project
- Before asking clarifying questions (so you ask the RIGHT questions)
- Need to understand what actually exists vs assumptions

**Use it to verify:**
- Is this feature request aligned with project purpose?
- Does this component/functionality actually exist?
- Are we focusing on real value (rendering, I/O, visualization) or imagined features (physics simulation)?

### For INVEST validation:
Load [references/INVEST_FRAMEWORK.md](references/INVEST_FRAMEWORK.md) when:
- User asks "what makes a good story?"
- Story seems to violate INVEST principles
- Need to explain why you're suggesting certain changes

### For story examples:
Load [references/STORY_TEMPLATES.md](references/STORY_TEMPLATES.md) when:
- User is new to story writing
- Need to show format variations (BDD vs bullets)
- Asked for examples of features, refactors, spikes, or bugs

**Don't load all references upfront.** Use progressive disclosure—load only what you need when you need it.
