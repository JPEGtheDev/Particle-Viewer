# Lessons Learned Patterns

Concrete examples of lessons captured from past sessions and how they were incorporated into project skills.

---

## Code Quality Lessons

### Binary File I/O (PR #73)

**Problem:** `getCOM()` opened binary data files with text mode (`"r"`), which on Windows translates `\r\n` bytes and corrupts binary reads.

**Lesson:** Always open binary data files with `"rb"` mode for cross-platform correctness.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Error Handling section, `testing` skill → Key Design Principles

### Return By Const Reference (PR #73)

**Problem:** `getProjection()` returned a `glm::mat4` by value, copying a 4x4 matrix every frame in the render loop.

**Lesson:** Return large objects (matrices, vectors, structs) by `const&` from getters when the member is stored in the class.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Common Pitfalls

### GLFW Key Bounds Check (PR #73)

**Problem:** `keys_[key]` indexed without validation. GLFW can pass `GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN` (-1), causing out-of-bounds access.

**Lesson:** Bounds-check GLFW key callbacks — `GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN` is -1.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → OpenGL Usage section

## Testing Lessons

### Separate Act and Assert (PR #64)

**Problem:** Tests combined `// Act & Assert` phases, making failures harder to diagnose.

**Lesson:** Always keep Act and Assert as separate phases, even when they seem naturally combined.

**Added to:** `testing` skill → Critical Rules, `TESTING_EXAMPLES.md` → Incorrect Examples

### Production Classes in Tests (PR #73)

**Problem:** Visual regression test helper duplicated Particle's cube generation logic, creating a maintenance burden and false confidence.

**Lesson:** Use production classes (e.g., `Particle`) directly in tests — never duplicate production logic in test helpers.

**Added to:** `testing` skill → Key Design Principles, `TESTING_EXAMPLES.md` → correct/incorrect patterns

### Ensure Output Directories Exist (PR #72)

**Problem:** Tests saved artifacts to `artifacts/` but only ensured `baselines/` existed. Silent write failures in CI.

**Lesson:** Ensure all output directories exist in test `SetUp()`, and check `save()` return values.

**Added to:** `testing` skill → Self-Review Checklist

### Camera Positioning for Visual Tests (PR #71)

**Problem:** Debug camera output was blindly copied as test camera coordinates, but debug shows interactive state, not ideal framing.

**Lesson:** Extract viewing direction from debug output, but calculate distance based on desired viewport coverage. Formula: `distance = subject_size / (coverage_% * tan(FOV/2))`.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Visual Regression Tests section, `docs/visual-regression/camera-positioning-lessons-learned.md`

---

## Architecture Lessons

### Group Related State Into Structs (PR #73)

**Problem:** `ViewerApp` had 10+ flat member variables for window, rendering, recording state.

**Lesson:** Group related member variables into POCOs/structs (e.g., `WindowConfig`, `RenderResources`). Structs should provide their own defaults.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Data Organization, `testing` skill → Key Design Principles

### Headers Must Be Self-Contained (PR #70)

**Problem:** `debugOverlay.hpp` used `std::cerr` without including `<iostream>`, relying on transitive includes.

**Lesson:** Headers must include all their own dependencies. Don't rely on transitive includes from other headers.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Common Pitfalls

### GL Resource Cleanup (PR #73)

**Problem:** `cleanup()` only deleted FBO, leaking other GL objects (textures, renderbuffers, VAOs, VBOs).

**Lesson:** Clean up ALL GL resources in destructors — VAOs, VBOs, FBOs, RBOs, textures. Check for non-zero before deleting.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Memory Management

### GL_POINT_SIZE_RANGE Clamping (PR #81)

**Problem:** Resolution independence test at 4K computed `gl_PointSize` of 366px, but hardware max was 256px. OpenGL silently clamped it, making the particle appear ~50% smaller. A loose test tolerance (0.01) masked the defect.

**Lesson:** `gl_PointSize` is silently clamped by `GL_POINT_SIZE_RANGE` (256px on Mesa/llvmpipe). When testing resolution-independent scaling, choose camera distances that keep computed point sizes under this limit at all target resolutions. Use tolerances proportional to the values being compared — an absolute tolerance larger than the expected value itself will mask real failures.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → OpenGL Usage

## Process Lessons

### Don't Modify README Unless Asked (PR #64)

**Problem:** Agent added visual regression testing docs to README, which wasn't requested.

**Lesson:** Don't update README unless specifically asked by the user.

### Skills Should Cross-Reference (PR #64)

**Problem:** Testing skill duplicated CI pipeline rules from workflow skill.

**Lesson:** Minimize duplication across skills. Each skill owns one domain. Skills reference other skills instead of repeating content.

**Added to:** `copilot-instructions.md` → Skill Architecture section

### Always Upload Current Images (PR #64)

**Problem:** Visual regression CI only uploaded artifacts on failure, making it hard to review passing tests.

**Lesson:** Always save and upload current rendered images, even when tests pass. Use `if: always()` on upload steps.

**Added to:** `workflow` skill → Artifact Upload Pattern
