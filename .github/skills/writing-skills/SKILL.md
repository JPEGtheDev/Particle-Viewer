## Iron Law

```
YOU MUST: VERIFY ALL FIVE GATE ELEMENTS BEFORE SHIPPING ANY SKILL. No exceptions.
```

Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.

**Announce at start:** "I am using the writing-skills skill to [create/edit/review] the [skill-name] skill."

---

## BEFORE PROCEEDING

Before creating, editing, or shipping any skill or agent template:

1. **Creating a new skill?** Invoked in >=1% of sessions? Place in the correct Domain-Driven Design (DDD) context (see AGENTS.md).
   - [+] -> proceed
   - [-] -> write a reference doc in the relevant skill's `references/` instead; do not create a skill

2. **5-element anatomy check** -- all 5 MUST be present (full schemas in `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md`):
   - FRONTMATTER: `name` + `description` starting with "Use when..."
   - IRON LAW: ALL CAPS rule + "Violating the letter..." line + "YOU MUST" + "No exceptions."
   - ANNOUNCEMENT: `**Announce at start:** "I am using the [skill] to [purpose]."`
   - GATE FUNCTION: `## BEFORE PROCEEDING` with numbered conditions + [+]/[-] branches
   - RATIONALIZATION TABLE: `## Rationalization Prevention` with >=5 rows
   - Not all 5 present -> add the missing element now; do not proceed until all 5 are in place.

3. **Alexandrian form check** -- every rule with more than one application context, or any rule that could be misapplied in an edge case, MUST answer Context + Forces. See `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md`.
   - Not met -> identify which rules lack Context/Forces; add them before proceeding.

4. **Modifying anatomy elements?** Read `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md` before any edits. Frontmatter-only changes: reference files optional.
   - Not met -> stop. Read `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md` now. Do not make edits until loaded.

5. **Auditing existing skills?** Load `skill-reviewer` agent template; inject 4 reference files; one agent per skill directory (reviews `SKILL.md` + all `references/` files).
   - Not following -> read `references/DISPATCH_PATTERN.md` before dispatching any review agents.

[+] All met -> proceed
[-] Any unmet -> see the "Not met ->" instruction on the failing condition above

## Red Flags -- STOP

- Creating a skill for a pattern in fewer than 1% of sessions -- **STOP. Write a reference doc instead.**
- Description field contains "covers", "enforces", "provides", "includes" -- **STOP. Rewrite to "Use when [conditions]."**
- Iron Law lacks "letter/spirit" line -- **STOP. Add "Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule." now.**
- Iron Law lacks "YOU MUST" and "No exceptions." -- **STOP. Both phrases are required. Add them.**
- No BEFORE PROCEEDING gate -- **STOP. Add a gate with explicit [+]/[-] branches before shipping.**
- No rationalization table -- **STOP. Add >=5 rows now. A skill without one is a suggestion.**
- Skill contains "should", "prefer", "consider" -- **STOP. Replace every instance with MUST, DO NOT, or an explicit imperative.**
- Skill or reference file contains non-ASCII characters -- **STOP. Replace non-ASCII arrows, em/en-dashes, math operators, and box-drawing chars with ASCII equivalents (-> -- - <= >= != | - +) before committing.**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The description is good enough as-is" | If it mentions what the skill does (not when to use it), models will follow the description instead of reading the skill |
| "Letter/spirit line is redundant" | It explicitly closes the rationalization that "technically I followed the rule" |
| "Rationalization tables are overkill" | They are the highest return-on-investment element -- they name and counter excuses before they occur |
| "This pattern only comes up occasionally" | Occasional patterns belong in a reference doc, not a skill. Skills loaded in every session cost context budget and dilute signal value. |
| "I'll add the gate function later" | A skill without a gate is a suggestion, not a constraint |
| "Context and Forces are extra writing overhead" | Rules without context misfire in edge cases. The overhead forces clarity about when the rule applies. |
