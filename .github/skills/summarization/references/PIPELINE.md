# Pipeline Reference -- Summarization Dispatch Instructions

Detailed per-agent prompt structure for the 5-agent summarization pipeline.

---

## Agents 1-3: Parallel Method Agents

Dispatch three `general-purpose` agents simultaneously via the `task` tool.

**Each agent receives:**
- Full source content (paste inline in the prompt -- do not pass a file path)
- Full method instructions from the relevant reference file (read and inline):
  - Abstractive agent: contents of `references/ABSTRACTIVE_METHOD.md`
  - Extractive agent: contents of `references/EXTRACTIVE_METHOD.md`
  - SAAC agent: contents of `references/SAAC_METHOD.md`

**Each agent returns:** A single method summary in the format defined by its reference file.

**Partial failure handling:**
- 1 of 3 agents fails -> proceed to synthesizer; synthesizer notes the missing method in the article
- 2 or more fail -> halt; report "BLOCKED: [N] method agents failed. Cannot synthesize."

## Agent 4: Synthesizer

Dispatch using `.github/agents/synthesizer.md` after all three method agents return.

Fill every `{{VARIABLE}}` slot:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{SOURCE_TITLE}}` | Title of the source (derive from content if not given) |
| `{{SOURCE_CONTENT}}` | Full source text |
| `{{ABSTRACTIVE_SUMMARY}}` | Output from Agent 1 |
| `{{EXTRACTIVE_SUMMARY}}` | Output from Agent 2 |
| `{{SAAC_SUMMARY}}` | Output from Agent 3 |
| `{{TEMP_PATH}}` | `scratch/summaries/temp-[kebab-source-title].md` |
| `{{OUTPUT_PATH}}` | Resolved output path, or `ASK_USER` if not yet determined |

The synthesizer writes the article to `{{TEMP_PATH}}` first and reports the temp path. The user can review the temp file while the quality agent runs.

---

## Agent 5: Quality Evaluator

Dispatch using `.github/agents/summarization-quality.md`. Can be dispatched in parallel with notifying the user of the temp path -- they do not need to be sequential.

Fill every `{{VARIABLE}}` slot:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{{SOURCE_CONTENT}}` | Full source text |
| `{{SYNTHESIZED_ARTICLE}}` | Full content of the temp file |
| `{{OUTPUT_PATH}}` | Resolved output path (must be known before quality writes) |
| `{{TEMP_PATH}}` | Same temp path used by synthesizer |

**If `{{OUTPUT_PATH}}` is `ASK_USER`:** Ask the user for the directory before dispatching the quality agent. Auto-derive the filename from `{{SOURCE_TITLE}}` (kebab-case + `.md`).

---

## Output Path Resolution

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|-----------|
| User provided explicit full path | Use it verbatim |
| User provided directory, no filename | `[directory]/[kebab-source-title].md` |
| No path provided | Ask for directory after temp file is written; auto-derive filename |

Derivation rule: "Test Frameworks Overview" -> `test-frameworks-overview.md`
