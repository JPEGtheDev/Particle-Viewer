## Profile Before Optimizing

Write code for clarity, flexibility, and correctness first. Optimize only after measurement proves it necessary. "I think this is slow" is not a profiling baseline.

The three rules of optimization:
1. Don't do it.
2. (For experts only) Don't do it yet.
3. Profile first, then optimize the measured bottleneck — not the guessed one.

This principle extends to any resource: memory allocation, network round-trips, disk access. The pattern of premature optimization is: implement something slower for clarity, observe hypothetical slowness, optimize without measuring, introduce complexity, discover the bottleneck was elsewhere.

## Assign Problems, Not Tasks

When delegating to a subagent or a collaborator, provide the problem and its constraints — not the implementation steps. An executor given steps will follow them even when the steps lead to the wrong outcome. An executor given the problem can recognize when circumstances require a different approach.

The distinction:
- Task assignment: "Add a pointer line to SKILL.md, then append the new section to the reference file, then commit."
- Problem assignment: "The SKILL.md needs a pointer to the new reference file for Six Thinking Hats. The file is over its word limit — use the minimum change that achieves the goal."

The first fails when the file has already been modified. The second adapts. Source: C2 Wiki "AssignProblemsNotTasks".

## Technical Debt Visibility

Technical debt is the cost of rework that accumulates when expedient solutions are chosen over correct ones. The debt itself is not always wrong — sometimes a quick solution is correct for the moment. The danger is invisible debt: shortcuts taken without recording that a shortcut was taken.

Rule: every deliberate shortcut must be marked at the decision point. Include: what the shortcut is, what the correct solution would be, and why the shortcut was chosen now. An unmarked shortcut becomes permanent. A marked one can be scheduled.

Do not use technical debt as a rationalization for low-quality work. Use it only to describe explicitly accepted trade-offs with a documented intent to revisit. Source: C2 Wiki "TechnicalDebt", "WardExplainsDebtMetaphor".

## Technical Debt Tracking Practices

Marking debt inline (see Technical Debt Visibility above) is necessary but not sufficient. Individual inline markers are invisible to planning until someone reads every file. Close the loop with a tracked list.

Practices:
- Maintain a **Technical Debt List** — a centralized tracked list of known shortcuts, workarounds, and structural problems. Each entry names the debt, its impact, and the effort required to repay it.
- Reference the debt list in planning. Debt that never appears in planning is debt that never gets repaid.

Invisible debt compounds. Inline markers make it discoverable; the debt list makes it plannable.

## Relentless Testing as Integration Prerequisite

Integration of any change into the shared codebase requires that all tests pass. This is not optional. A failing test on the integration branch means the branch is broken for everyone until it is fixed.

"Relentless testing" means:
- Tests run before every integration, not just before release
- A failing test stops integration — it is not merged around, deferred, or silenced
- The test suite is fast enough that developers run it habitually

The cost of a broken integration is shared by the whole team. The cost of running the tests belongs to one developer. Keep that asymmetry in mind.

---

## Atomic Refactoring Steps

Each refactoring step must leave the system in a working state. Never accumulate multiple refactoring changes across a session before verifying. After each step:
1. Build succeeds
2. All tests pass
3. Behavior is identical to before the step

Breaking refactoring into atomic steps makes it reversible at any point. If a step breaks the build, revert immediately — do not attempt to fix forward. Small steps with frequent verification are always safer than large restructuring with deferred verification.

---

## Refactoring Friction as Signal

If a refactoring feels expensive, risky, or requires extensive coordination, that friction is information — not a reason to skip the refactoring. High friction signals:
- Tight coupling that should be loosened
- Missing abstractions that make changes ripple
- Inadequate test coverage that makes changes risky
- Unclear ownership that requires coordination

Address the source of friction rather than working around it. A system that is hard to refactor is a system that is accumulating structural debt.
