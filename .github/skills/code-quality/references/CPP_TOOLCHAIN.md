# C++ Toolchain Configuration

Clang-format settings and clang-tidy configuration for Particle-Viewer.

---

## clang-format Settings

Auto-enforced via `.clang-format`. Key settings:

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Standard | C++20 |
| Indentation | 4 spaces (no tabs) |
| Line length | 120 characters |
| Functions/classes braces | Allman (new line) |
| Control structure braces | K&R (same line) |
| Include order | C++ standard → system → external libs → project headers |
| Pointer alignment | Left (`int* ptr`) |

Full configuration: `.clang-format`

## clang-tidy Commands

```bash
# Analyze a source file
clang-tidy src/main.cpp -- -Isrc/glad/include

# Analyze using compilation database
clang-tidy src/particle.hpp -p build

# Auto-fix (always review auto-fix output before committing — it can change behavior)
clang-tidy -fix src/main.cpp -- -Isrc/glad/include
```

Configuration in `.clang-tidy` enforces:
- `modernize-*` — Modern C++ practices (smart pointers, nullptr, auto, range-based loops)
- `readability-*` — Const correctness, function complexity (≤25 cognitive, ≤50 statements, <5 params)
- `cppcoreguidelines-*` — Microsoft C++ Core Guidelines
- `performance-*`, `bugprone-*`, `portability-*`, `clang-analyzer-*`

Header filter excludes embedded libs: `glad`, `tinyFileDialogs`, `stb_*`.

**CI status:** clang-tidy runs in CI as advisory (non-blocking). clang-format is blocking.

# PV Workflow Patterns

## Step 7: Adding a Feature / Fixing a Bug

### New Feature Workflow
1. **Scan the class interface** — before writing integration code that calls methods on an existing class, verify which members are public/private. Classes like `Camera` have a mix; don't assume public.
2. Make code changes following naming conventions
3. Add unit tests in `tests/core/` (see `testing` skill)
4. Run `clang-format -i` on ALL changed files
5. Build and verify tests pass
6. Commit: `feat: description`

### Removing Features / User-Requested Changes
When removing a gamepad feature or call site from `viewer_app.cpp` at user request, **do not also delete the supporting `Camera` public method**. The Camera API is stable across sessions; call sites in `viewer_app` change frequently with user preferences. Removing `isRenderingSphere()` when L3/R3 was dropped meant restoring it when L3/R3 came back one session later. Only remove a Camera method if it is architecturally wrong, not merely unused at the current moment.

### Bug Fix Workflow
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code
3. Verify test passes, run full suite
4. Run `clang-format -i` on changed files
5. Commit: `fix: description`
