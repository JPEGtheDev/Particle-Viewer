## Iron Law

```
YOU MUST: VERIFY ALL FIVE GATE ELEMENTS BEFORE SHIPPING ANY SKILL. No exceptions.
```

Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.

**Announce at start:** "I am using the writing-skills skill to [create/edit/review] the [skill-name] skill."

---

## BEFORE PROCEEDING

Before creating, editing, or shipping any skill or agent template:

1. **Creating a new skill?** Invoked in >=1% of sessions? Place in the correct Domain-Driven Design (DDD) context (see AGENTS.md).
   - [+] -> proceed
   - [-] -> write a reference doc in the relevant skill's `references/` instead; do not create a skill

2. **5-element anatomy check** -- all 5 MUST be present (full schemas in `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md`):
   - FRONTMATTER: `name` + `description` starting with "Use when..."
   - IRON LAW: ALL CAPS rule + "Violating the letter..." line + "YOU MUST" + "No exceptions."
   - ANNOUNCEMENT: `**Announce at start:** "I am using the [skill] to [purpose]."`
   - GATE FUNCTION: `## BEFORE PROCEEDING` with numbered conditions + [+]/[-] branches
   - RATIONALIZATION TABLE: `## Rationalization Prevention` with >=5 rows
   - Not all 5 present -> add the missing element now; do not proceed until all 5 are in place.

3. **Alexandrian form check** -- every rule with more than one application context, or any rule that could be misapplied in an edge case, MUST answer Context + Forces. See `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md`.
   - Not met -> identify which rules lack Context/Forces; add them before proceeding.

4. **Compressing a skill?** For every ban or prohibited phrase in SKILL.md, verify its safe substitute is also in SKILL.md -- not only in a references/ file.
   - [+] Ban and substitute co-located in SKILL.md -> proceed
   - [-] Substitute is only in references/ -> move the substitute into SKILL.md before shipping.

5. **Modifying anatomy elements OR adding a Red Flag about anatomy format?** Read `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md` before writing or editing. When the Red Flag makes a format assertion ("MUST be inside/outside X", "MUST appear in Y position"), cite the specific line from `SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md`. A wrong format claim in `writing-skills` becomes the schema that ALL skill reviewers validate against -- propagating the error to every future review.
   - Not met -> stop. Read `references/SKILL_ANATOMY_ELEMENTS.md` now. Do not write the Red Flag until the canonical position is verified and cited.

6. **Auditing existing skills?** Load `skill-reviewer` agent template; inject 4 reference files; one agent per skill directory (reviews `SKILL.md` + all `references/` files).
   - Not following -> read `references/DISPATCH_PATTERN.md` before dispatching any review agents.

7. **Adding, removing, or renaming a reference file?** Ensure `references/INDEX.md` exists and is updated to reflect the change. Follow `references/REFERENCE_INDEX_FORMAT.md` for the required YAML frontmatter, file table, and Related section.
   - [+] INDEX.md exists and lists this file -> proceed
   - [-] INDEX.md missing or stale -> create or update it before committing

[+] All met -> proceed
[-] Any unmet -> see the "Not met ->" instruction on the failing condition above

---

## Red Flags -- STOP

- Creating a skill for a pattern in fewer than 1% of sessions -- **STOP. Write a reference doc instead.**
- Description field contains "covers", "enforces", "provides", "includes" -- **STOP. Rewrite to "Use when [conditions]."**
- Description starts with "Use when [trigger]" but continues with workflow clauses ("to conduct", "to produce", "to generate", "to create", "to interview") -- **STOP. End the description at the triggering condition. Drop all "to [verb]" workflow suffixes.**
- Iron Law lacks "letter/spirit" line -- **STOP. Add "Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule." now.**
- Iron Law letter/spirit line is inside the backtick block -- **STOP. The "Violating the letter..." line MUST appear OUTSIDE the backtick fence, immediately after the closing backtick. Placing it inside the fence before the closing backtick is the most common Iron Law anatomy error.**
- Iron Law lacks "YOU MUST" and "No exceptions." -- **STOP. Both phrases are required. Add them.**
- No BEFORE PROCEEDING gate -- **STOP. Add a gate with explicit [+]/[-] branches before shipping.**
- No rationalization table -- **STOP. Add >=5 rows now. A skill without one is a suggestion.**
- Skill contains "should", "prefer", "consider" -- **STOP. Replace every instance with MUST, DO NOT, or an explicit imperative.**
- Skill or reference file contains non-ASCII characters -- **STOP. Replace non-ASCII arrows, em/en-dashes, math operators, and box-drawing chars with ASCII equivalents (-> -- - <= >= != | - +) before committing.**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The description is good enough as-is" | If it mentions what the skill does (not when to use it), models will follow the description instead of reading the skill |
| "Letter/spirit line is redundant" | It explicitly closes the rationalization that "technically I followed the rule" |
| "Rationalization tables are overkill" | They are the highest return-on-investment element -- they name and counter excuses before they occur |
| "This pattern only comes up occasionally" | Occasional patterns belong in a reference doc, not a skill. Skills loaded in every session cost context budget and dilute signal value. |
| "I'll add the gate function later" | A skill without a gate is a suggestion, not a constraint |
| "Context and Forces are extra writing overhead" | Rules without context misfire in edge cases. The overhead forces clarity about when the rule applies. |
