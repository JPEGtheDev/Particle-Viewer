# code-quality References Index

Universal files fire for every code task. OOP tier fires only when the trigger in SKILL.md Step 2 matches.

---

## Universal Tier

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `code-smells.md` | 6 universal smells from Fowler's _Refactoring_ -- Long Method, Duplicated Code, Long Parameter List, Speculative Generality, Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery |
| `design-principles.md` | Design heuristics from Ward Cunningham's C2 wiki -- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI), Composed Method, Beck's Rules; all paradigms |

---

## OOP Tier (`oop/`)

### C++ (`oop/cpp/`)

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `oop/cpp/index.md` | Dispatch table: trigger conditions + ordered 5-check list + pass/fail gate |
| `oop/cpp/review-checklist.md` | Full pre-commit checklist -- format, build, tests, Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), headers |
| `oop/cpp/oop-smells.md` | 12 OOP-specific smells from Fowler's _Refactoring_ -- Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, etc. |
| `oop/cpp/cpp-toolchain.md` | clang-format and clang-tidy configuration |
| `oop/cpp/formatting-rules.md` | Human-reviewable formatting patterns clang-format does not catch |
| `oop/cpp/naming-tables.md` | Naming convention tables by category for OOP identifiers |
| `oop/cpp/invocation.md` | How the OOP tier is invoked; maps to the tier check sequence |

### Python (`oop/python/`) -- deferred

`oop/python/` does not exist yet. Apply universal tier only for Python OOP files.
